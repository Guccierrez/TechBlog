## About The Project

Tech blogs come and go, but this one is here to stay! This web app allows users to log in
and save their personal posts. From their profile they'll be able to not only post but delete those post 
once they are no longer neccessary! The will even be able to view others posts from the homepage and once they're done
they simply log off and call it a day
